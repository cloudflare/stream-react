  /**
   * Tells the browser to immediately start downloading the video and play it as soon as it can. Note that mobile browsers generally do not support this attribute, the user must tap the screen to begin video playback. Please consider mobile users or users with Internet usage limits as some users don’t have unlimited Internet access before using this attribute.
   *
   * In addition, some browsers now prevent videos with audio from playing automatically. You may add the mute attribute to allow your videos to autoplay. For more information, [go here](https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/).

Not including the attribute or using preload="metadata" will just load the metadata needed to start video playback when requested.
   *
   * The <video> element does not force the browser to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint. Even though the preload="none" option is a valid HTML5 attribute, Stream player will always load some metadata to initialize the player. The amount of data loaded in this case is negligable.
